## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* The purpose of the analysis.
* The data in this project was on credit risk, this model predicited wehter a loan was healthy or high risk.
* This project divided the lending data into a y variable (loan status) and x variables (loan size, Interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts and total debt).


## Results


* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  * The Machine learning model 1 had an accuracy of 94%.
  * 138 out of 19,384 entries were entered incorrectly. 
  * Based on the classification report, the spe module recorded an accuracy of 90%, and the iba module recorded an accuracy of 91%.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  * The Machine learning model 1 had an accuracy of 99%.
  * 89 out of 19,384 entries were entered incorrectly. 
  * Based on the classification report, all modules recorded an accuracy of 99% or higher. 

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
Oversampling the data solves the problem of imbalanced classes so therefore the machine learrning model with over sampled data is more accurate than the original csv.
